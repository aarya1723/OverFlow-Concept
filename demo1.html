				Data interpretation (or analysis) has the objective of presenting quantative facts in
				different ways, to facilitate highlighting of different aspects of or different
				perceptions in a quantitative situation. To this end quantitative data are expressed in
				purely verbal terms or depicted visually, or by a combination of both modes of
				expression. The test usually involves the understanding of data presented in one
				way, followed by analysis of it and re-presenting it in a different way. The customary
				multiple-choice responses are given, and one has to opt for one of them as the one
				that best meets the needs.
